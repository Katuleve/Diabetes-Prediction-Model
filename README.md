Diabetes Prediction Application
Introduction
The Diabetes Prediction Application is an innovative tool designed to predict diabetes using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing various health metrics, this application can provide an early indication of diabetes, helping users to take proactive health measures.

Features
Predictive Modeling: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of a user developing diabetes based on input health metrics.
User-Friendly Interface: Easy to use interface that allows users to input their health data without any hassle.
Health Metrics Analysis: Analyzes a range of health metrics such as glucose levels, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), age, and more.
Instant Feedback: Provides users with immediate prediction results, enabling quick and informed health decisions.
Privacy First: Ensures user data privacy and security, with a commitment to not storing personal health information.
